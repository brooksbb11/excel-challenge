# Excel-Challenge
Module 1 Assignment
# Background 
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.


## Report Analysis 

# Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
The success rate is the highest and it is consistent, same goes for the failed rate. It is consistent across the way but does have a spike during the month of august, whereas the canceled rate is consistent with staying below 10.

That means we had a pretty good success rate of using crowdfunding campaigns. However, when you filter the data by year and month you will see variations in the data. 

The data does give the reader a clear indication on what months had the most attempts and how each month did. 

# What are some limitations of this dataset?

Some limitations are that you need to filter to find the data you want. Also, it looks like it was consistent over the years, but some years were better than others. Also, there are limitations as to why we do not have a goal to compare the success or failed rate too. 

# What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?

Other possible tables/graphs that I would create would be a stacked bar graph to show the part to whole relationships for that specific month and then year. So, you could easily look up and see what year, month, ect. was the crowdfunding most successful.
